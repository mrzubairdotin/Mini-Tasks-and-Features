Mini-Tasks-and-Features
This repository is a personal collection of small tasks and projects where I practice frontend development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's meant for experimenting with different coding concepts and improving my skills through hands-on projects.

Focus on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
A space for learning and tracking progress.
